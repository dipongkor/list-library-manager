# SharePoint List/Library Manager

is always time consuming. This Add-in has been built with AngularJs and SharePoint REST API and its a single page app.

In home page, you will get all lists/libraries with pagination. Let's say now you want to find all **Document Library** in your site. It's 
not possible using default feature. In site content, you will get all lists and libraries but find them by a specific template is not 
possible. So this is your app to find list/library by a specific template.
